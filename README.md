### Hi folks 👋

I'm Jipé and I'm 34 years old. I'm married and I have 2 terrific kids: they are 11-month-old twins, and it's quite a big job on a daily basis 😂. 

I've been working in the tech industry for almost 14 years now. I started as a front-end developer in a small start-up. They quickly pivoted to mobile games and this is when I learned iOS development. After this, I joined a college friend of mine in a more well-known start-up: BlaBlaCar. This is where I learned a lot as a developer, engineer, and software architect. Then, I transitioned from small to medium-sized startups and landed in a fin-tech company (where I'm still working as an iOS engineer).
